# Research-Papers-Methods-and-Methodologies

This repository was created to fulfill an assignment for the **Informatics Research** course, which requires me to find and collect several papers discussing **methods** and **methodologies** in the field of informatics research. The purpose of this task is to enhance my understanding of the various methods and methodologies used in research, as well as how these methods are implemented to solve real-world problems.

The papers I collected are divided into two categories:

1. **Methods in Paper**: This category includes papers that focus on specific methods used in research. These methods involve particular techniques utilized to achieve the desired outcomes, such as image processing, deep learning, and pattern recognition.

2. **Methodologies in Paper**: This category includes papers that focus on the overall research methodologies, ranging from data collection approaches to analysis strategies used to develop solutions. Methodologies encompass the use of algorithms, frameworks, and other scientific approaches to solve research problems.

Below is a list of the papers I have collected, grouped into **Methods** and **Methodologies**.
